# ChainLink Hackathon

Healthcare data is the most valued data in the world. Nowadays it lacks interoperability, despite efforts from teams behind HL7/FHIR. In addition, there are severe privacy and security problems that haunt this precious data. This can be tackled by the use of blockchain technology and Chainlink.

Our project will bring healthcare data from standard databases - such as PostgreSQL - to the on-chain space, by leveraging the use of Chainlink API features. Initially, this data will be stored on IPFS and FileCoin's OrbidDB. This way, we can guarantee the security and privacy of the data, giving more control to the patient, as he can see at any time who has access to it.

This has no effect on the old systems, as hospital staff can keep using legacy databases. The connection using Chainlink simply enables a more cryptographic-proven management of sensitive data. It can also serve as a platform to build web3 health-applications.

Currenlty deployed on Rinkeby Testnet (0x7fd2952f9C6624b0fd28e8a67B1004D55e0Da418).
