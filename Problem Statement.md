## Problem Statement

According to HippaJournal, Between 2009 and 2020, 3,705 healthcare data breaches of 500 or more records have been reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights. Those breaches have resulted in the loss, theft, exposure, or impermissible disclosure of 268,189,693 healthcare records. That equates to more than 81.72% of the population of the United States. In 2018, healthcare data breaches of 500 or more records were being reported at a rate of around 1 per day. In December 2020, that rate had doubled. The average number of breaches per day for 2020 was 1.76.

## Using BlockChain to solve this problem.

Blockchain technology can transform healthcare by increasing the security, privacy of health data while eliminating bureaucracy, data breaches, inefficiencies, improving quality of care and democratizing patient data. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, smart contracts, Filecoin's OrbitDB and Chainlink's extrnal-adapter ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality.

## Blockchain Technology Smart Contract and Adequate and Secure Medical Record Keeping

- Blockchain’s “Smart Contract” allows a patient to transfer their medical history/data on the blockchain network, which can only be accessed by them and the address they grant permissions to (Doctors or Physicians). These permissions can also be edited and revoked which means patients will have the freedom to change hospitals without the need to fill in forms as their new physicians can view all their information on the blockchain network.

- A Doctor/Physician can prescribe a medication for the patients which will be encrypted with the patient’s public key and can only be decrypted by the patient’s private keys. This means patients can be the only one to query their own prescription and a prescriber can query all the patient’s records across healthcare institutions after being approved by the patient. This improves privacy and security of the patient’s medical records.


### The above statement helps solves the following:

#### Sources: getreferralmd
- 3 of every ten tests are reordered because the results cannot be found.
These test results and labs are most likely lost somewhere in the care continuum, whether it be during the transfer from lab to PCP or specialist, or the transfer within hospital departments.  This tends to result in redundant tests, which directly leads to the increasing cost of care; but more importantly, can lead to missed diagnoses and treatments, resulting in further injury or even death.

- Patient charts cannot be found on 30% of visits.
This is a major reason why there has been such a push to move all medical offices and health institutions onto electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR). By inputting all patient health information into a secure and large database, it eliminates the possibility for patient information to be physically lost or misplaced.

- The average organization spends about $20 in labor to file each paper document.

- According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the average health organization spends approximately $120 in labor searching for each misfiled document, and $220 for the re-creation of a document.

- About 80% of all serious medical errors involve miscommunication during care transitions (to different care settings).
This includes information among colleagues, between patient and physician, inaccessible medical records, etc.
Approximately one-quarter of U.S. patients reported that the results and records from one provider did not reach another provider in time for their appointment.
This lack of communication between providers in the care continuum can lead to improper care and further ailment. The fact that 1 in 4 patients have to reiterate their medical history multiple times to multiple providers is detrimental to quality affordable health care.

- Only 41% of U.S. hospitals in 2013 reported that their providers are able to send and receive secure electronic messages with patient health information to and from external sources.
- Only 4 in 10 hospitals report that their providers can send and receive secure electronic messages withholding confidential patient health information to and from sources outside of the health system or organization.


- Blockchain for patient consent management
Do we really need to explain how much of a pain this is? You need to get all sorts permissions, opt-ins and informed consent from patients. On top of that, it’s imperative to be compliant with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) when handling protected health information.
Nevertheless, blockchain technology proposes a noteworthy solution to the mess that is consent management.
